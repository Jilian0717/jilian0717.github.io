Hi there, 
======
My name is Jilian and I'm a postdoc working with Dr. [Parker MacCready](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/). My research focuses on understanding how estuarine and coastal circulations influence biological or biogeochemical processes, such as [harmful algal bloom](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X22008694), [hypoxia](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JC017592), and [eDNAüß¨](https://www.ednacollab.org/mmarinedna-about). To answer "What does physics üåä do to biogeochemistryüêü", I use realistic oceanographic numerical models, including [LiveOcean](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/LiveOcean.html) (built based on ROMS), [SCHISM](https://schism-dev.github.io/schism/master/index.html), and EFDC. Besides utilizing the existent numerical model framework, I enjoy making model developments, such as adding growth and decay processes to numerical particles to represent the life cycle of [algal blooms](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10308), controlling the [virtual clock ‚è∞](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JC017592) that is attached to the surface-produced particulates to record the time for them to stay in the water column or in the sediments. So far, I have experience working on two large estuarine systems, the Chesapeake Bay (east coast) and the Salish Sea (west coast). I love analyzing data both from observations and from model outputs. It is always fun to generate beautiful and (of course) scientific-solid figures.

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, jogging, and road trips.
