**Ocean transport drives eDNA dispersal in Hood Canal**
======
Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used for species detection and biodiversity monitoring in marine environments. The dynamic nature of these environments affects eDNA distribution relative to its source organisms, complicating the interpretation of eDNA observations and challenging field sampling design. Here, an eDNA fate and transport model, built on an ocean model with Lagrangian particle tracking, <img class="col one last" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/publication_preview/eDNA.png" style="float:right; width: 50%; height: 50%"> provided a best estimate of the rapid dilution of eDNA shed by rare targets before sampling. Over 70% of the pre-selected stations detected the target eDNA. Despite potential variations in source strength and patchy distributions, the model-predicted particles explained approximately 40% of the observed variation in eDNA abundance; by comparison, eDNA concentration was uncorrelated with Euclidean distance alone or with a simplified oceanographic model. Our study revealed the extent of ocean transport in shaping eDNA distribution and abundance, and demonstrated the utility of ocean models and particle tracking in integrating marine eDNA observations with degradation, transport, and dilution process; thus suggests broader applications to enhance understanding of eDNA signals and dispersals, and optimize sampling strategies in other marine environments.
